# FastAPI Project with Spotipy

This project uses FastAPI to create an API that interacts with the Spotify API through the Spotipy library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Conda
- A Spotify account and Spotify API credentials (client ID and client secret)

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh

    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Create the Conda environment:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3. Activate the environment:
    ```sh
    conda activate FastAPI
    ```

## Spotify Credentials

1. Obtain your client ID and client secret from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your credentials:
    ```plaintext
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
    ```

## Running the Application
